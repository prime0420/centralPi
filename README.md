# Central PI UI (scaffold)

This is a minimal Create React App (TypeScript) scaffold with starter components for the Factory, Shift, and Timeline views. Graphs are simple SVG/div primitives (no external graph packages).

Quick start (from `central-pi-ui`):

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

Notes:
- This is a starter scaffold. You will likely replace the sample data with real local Pi data and refine the visuals.
- I kept graphs minimal so you can extend them or swap in light graph packages later.
